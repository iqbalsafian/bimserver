# bimserver
This project is designed to show the usage of Java API for <a href="bimserver.org">BIMServer</a> projects.
It's using gradle instead of recommended maven requested by my client in Singapore.

BIMServer is widely used in Europe and will replace traditionally method of project management in property development.
